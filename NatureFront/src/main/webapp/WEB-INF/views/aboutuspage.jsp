<h3 align="center"><u>WELCOME</u></h3>
<p align="center">At NatureProduct.com, we believe everyone deserves to have a website or online store. Innovation and simplicity makes us happy: our goal is to remove any technical or financial barriers that can prevent business owners from making their own website. We're excited to help you on your journey!</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><u>OUR STORY</u></h3>
<p align="center">NatureProduc.com began in 2005. After years in the web hosting industry, we realized that it was near impossible for the average Jane or Joe to create their own website. Traditional web hosting services were simply too complicated, time consuming, and expensive to manage.</p> 
<p align="center">We created the Website.com Site Builder with the user's perspective in mind. We wanted to offer a platform that would require no coding skills or design experience. We keep it simple, so users can focus on creating an amazing website that reflects their brand. Best of all - it's free. You can get online, showcase your brand, or start selling products right away.</p>
<hr>
<h3 align="center"><u>OUR VALUES</u></h3>
<h4 align="center"><u>Every Individual Deserves a Website</u></h4>
<p align="center">We believe every individual should have the power to create their own website or online store. If you can point and click, you can create a professional website or online store using our free and intuitive tools.</p> 
<hr>
<h4 align="center"><u>Our Customers Mean the World</u></h4>
<p align="center">At NatureProduct.com, we strive to provide exactly what our customers are looking for. A huge part of our brainstorming process is looking at our client feedback to make sure you're well taken care of.</p>
